# CurrencyDetector

This project aim to provide a solution for currency detection. Currenly it is configured with romanian currency but the way the program is designed allows for an easy set up for any currency(simply swap the image and folders in the 'samples' data with
your banknotes and values)

As a feature extractor I have used ORB along with BFmatcher.

The GUI is written in tkinter with ttk widgets(system theme)
